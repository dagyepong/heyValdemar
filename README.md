🧩 I’ve been in the IT game for over 5 years, and using Linux has really been great so far! These days, I wear the hat of a Cyber Security Analyst, but what really gets me going is Docker and container technology. Can't say much but the tech is truly an obsession!

🧩 I have my own IT [blog](https://tech.nanaoware.online/), where I share knowledge with enthusiasts who share my love for all things Docker, containers, and IT technologies in general. And to make sure everyone can jump on this awesome DevOps train, I write super detailed guides (seriously, they’re foolproof!) that help even newbies deploy and manage complex IT solutions.

🧩 My dream is to become a certified ethical hacker, and empower every single person in the tech community to safeguard their digital footprints.
 I’m stoked to share my knowledge, experiences, and a good dose of passion for the tech. My aim is to encourage learning, innovation, and growth, and to inspire the next generation of IT whizz-kids to push Docker and container tech to its limits.

Let’s do this together!
